Simple C Sharp (C#) HTTP Client
===============================

An extremely stripped down HTTP client that does not use System.Web for use in Unity iOS projects.

This is a very simple, very stripped down HTTP client for use with Unity on iOS so you can still build projects with the .NET 2.0 Subset and
have reasonable sized apps produced.

It has only been tested doing very simple GET and POST requests to an Apache server.

It doesn't do very much, but can easily be extended for your own requirements (such as setting headers).

Use at your own risk!

It's MIT licensed. Pull requests are welcome, but only if they do not add dependencies. (I'll add a list of what's OK at some point)
